        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "At B & H Barber Shop, our grey blending services start at $35, while full color services begin at $45. The process typically takes 30-45 minutes for grey blending and 45-60 minutes for full color. Prices may vary depending on hair length and the amount of grey coverage needed. We recommend booking a quick consultation first so we can provide an accurate quote for your specific needs."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our grey blending typically lasts 3-4 weeks, depending on your hair growth and how frequently you wash your hair. For the most natural-looking results, we recommend scheduling touch-ups every 3-4 weeks. We offer a loyalty program where every 6th grey blending service comes with a $10 discount. Many of our Long Island City clients schedule regular appointments to maintain their preferred look."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, we strongly recommend appointments for all color services. While we accept walk-ins for regular cuts, grey blending and color services require specific time slots and preparation. You can book an appointment by calling us at our East Village location or through our online booking system. We typically have availability within 2-3 days, though weekend slots fill up quickly."

        "text": "We exclusively use professional-grade color products from Redken and Matrix, specifically designed for men's hair. All our products are PPD-free and gentle on the scalp. Before any color service, we perform a patch test 24 hours prior to ensure you won't have any allergic reactions. Our barbers are licensed by the New York State Division of Licensing Services and certified in men's color techniques."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely! In fact, we recommend combining your grey blending with a haircut for the most natural-looking results. When booked together, we'll typically do the color service first, followed by the cut and style. The combined service usually takes about 60-75 minutes total. We offer a $10 discount when you book both services together. Just let us know when making your appointment so we can allocate enough time."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been going to B & H for about 8 months now. Tony does an amazing job with my grey blending - super natural looking, not that fake dark look you get at some places. The first time I went in I was nervous about coloring my hair but he walked me through the whole process. Takes about 25 mins and lasts around 3-4 weeks. Only giving 4 stars cause sometimes the wait can be long on weekends, but worth it for the quality.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Found this place when my usual barber retired and I'm so glad I did! I get my undercut maintained here and recently tried their grey blending service since I'm starting to get some greys at my temples (ugh). Mike is fantastic - super precise with both the cut and color. Love that they use high quality products and take their time to get things right. The East Village vibe of the shop is cool too, nice change from sterile salon environments.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Quick review - solid barbershop, been going here 2+ years. They do good grey coverage that doesn't look obvious or fake. Price is fair ($35 for blend). Only thing is parking can be tough in this area so plan ahead. But yeah, definitely recommend these guys if you want a legit old school barber who knows what they're doing with modern services.</div>

For the most natural-looking results, we recommend scheduling touch-ups every 3-4 weeks. We offer a loyalty program where every 6th grey blending service comes with a $10 discount. Many of our Long Island City clients schedule regular appointments to maintain their preferred look.</div>

                        <summary>Do I need to make an appointment for grey blending services?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, we strongly recommend appointments for all color services. While we accept walk-ins for regular cuts, grey blending and color services require specific time slots and preparation. You can book an appointment by calling us at our East Village location or through our online booking system. We typically have availability within 2-3 days, though weekend slots fill up quickly.</div>

                        <summary>What type of grey blending products do you use, and are they safe?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We exclusively use professional-grade color products from Redken and Matrix, specifically designed for men's hair. All our products are PPD-free and gentle on the scalp. Before any color service, we perform a patch test 24 hours prior to ensure you won't have any allergic reactions. Our barbers are licensed by the New York State Division of Licensing Services and certified in men's color techniques.</div>

                        <summary>Can I get my regular haircut done at the same time as grey blending?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely! In fact, we recommend combining your grey blending with a haircut for the most natural-looking results. When booked together, we'll typically do the color service first, followed by the cut and style. The combined service usually takes about 60-75 minutes total. We offer a $10 discount when you book both services together. Just let us know when making your appointment so we can allocate enough time.</div>
