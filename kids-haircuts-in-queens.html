You can book by calling us at our East Village location or using our online booking system. Walk-ins are welcome, but please note that wait times can be 30-45 minutes during peak hours."

We have special booster seats and child-friendly cape options for younger kids. All our prices include a wash and style. We welcome children of all ages, but those under 3 must be accompanied by a parent who can help keep them steady during the cut."

We have TVs at each station playing kid-friendly content, lollipops for after the cut, and special character-themed capes. We take extra time to explain the process to nervous kids and let them touch (safe) tools before starting. Parents are welcome to stay right beside their child, and we can do the cut in stages with breaks if needed. Our goal is to make it a positive experience."

We use professional-grade tools and products safe for children's sensitive skin. The entire service typically takes 20-30 minutes, depending on the hairstyle and child's comfort level. We finish with a light spritz of water and styling, plus a quick cleanup around the neck and ears. Every cut includes our signature neck brush cleanup and final inspection with parents."

We offer quieter appointment times (usually first thing in the morning), can dim lights if needed, and have noise-canceling headphones available. Please let us know about any specific requirements when booking, and we'll match you with our most experienced barber for your child's needs. We're happy to do the cut in stages or adapt our process to make your child comfortable."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Finally found a place that knows how to handle my 4-year-old son's curly hair! Tony was so patient when Kevin got fidgety halfway through the cut. He kept making silly faces and telling jokes to keep him distracted. The lollipop at the end was a nice touch too. Been coming here for about 6 months now - way better than those chain places we used to go to. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is sometimes the wait can be long on weekends.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Great spot for kids cuts. My twins (7) hate getting haircuts but B&H makes it bearable. They have those little car seats for younger kids and iPads with games. Prices are reasonable - $20 for kids under 12. Joe always remembers how they like their hair done. Quick tip: try to go on weekday afternoons, much less crowded.</div>

We welcome children of all ages, but those under 3 must be accompanied by a parent who can help keep them steady during the cut.</div>

                        <summary>How do you handle children who are nervous about getting haircuts?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our barbers are specially trained to work with anxious children. We have TVs at each station playing kid-friendly content, lollipops for after the cut, and special character-themed capes. We take extra time to explain the process to nervous kids and let them touch (safe) tools before starting. Parents are welcome to stay right beside their child, and we can do the cut in stages with breaks if needed. Our goal is to make it a positive experience.</div>

                        <summary>What's included in a typical kids' haircut at B & H Barber Shop?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Each kids' haircut includes a consultation with parent and child, shampoo (if desired), the cut itself, and styling. We use professional-grade tools and products safe for children's sensitive skin. The entire service typically takes 20-30 minutes, depending on the hairstyle and child's comfort level. We finish with a light spritz of water and styling, plus a quick cleanup around the neck and ears. Every cut includes our signature neck brush cleanup and final inspection with parents.</div>
