        "text": "Our basic beard trim and shape service is $35. For fuller beards or more detailed styling work, the price ranges from $40-50. A standard beard service typically takes 30-35 minutes, while more intricate styling can take up to 45 minutes. We recommend booking extra time if you'd like a consultation about beard growth patterns or styling options specific to your face shape."

You can book online through our website or call us at our East Village location. We typically can accommodate same-day appointments if you call before 2pm on weekdays."

We also provide advice on maintaining your beard between visits and product recommendations tailored to your beard type and texture."

Ideally, let it grow for at least 2-3 weeks before your visit. During your first appointment, we'll assess your growth pattern and face shape to recommend styles that will work best for you. Don't worry if you're unsure - our barbers are experienced in working with first-timers."

Our barbers are all licensed by New York State and have specialized training in beard care and styling. We also guarantee that we only use sterilized equipment and follow all NYC health department regulations for barbershops."

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Been going to B & H for about 2 years now, mainly for beard maintenance. Tony always hooks me up with exactly what I want - he's got a real eye for detail with beard shaping. The shop has this cool old-school vibe but they definitely know modern styles too. Only minor complaint is sometimes the wait can be long on Saturdays, but that's just because they're good at what they do. Worth the wait tbh.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Finally found a barber who knows how to handle my partner's super curly beard! We tried 3 other places before finding B & H. Mike took his time, explained everything he was doing, and showed my boyfriend exactly how to maintain the shape at home. The hot towel treatment at the end was a nice touch. Prices are fair for NYC - $35 for a beard trim/shape. Already booked another appointment for next month!</div>

                        <summary>I've never had my beard professionally trimmed before - how do I prepare?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Come in with your beard clean and dry. It's helpful to have reference photos of styles you like, but don't trim your beard yourself beforehand. Ideally, let it grow for at least 2-3 weeks before your visit. During your first appointment, we'll assess your growth pattern and face shape to recommend styles that will work best for you. Don't worry if you're unsure - our barbers are experienced in working with first-timers.</div>
